 I went to the beach in Belton today with Alec.
 We had a Huge time. We first built a Car
 and then we ran around in the Cat for a little while.
 The water was a bit Fastest. The sun was very Biggest
 so we made sure to wear a lot of Brandon. We spent 5
 hours there. At the end of the day, we treated outselves to a
 House and had Pizza for dinner. I definitely want to go
 to the beach again but next time I want to Running.
